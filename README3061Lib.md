# 3061-lib </br>

Huskie Robotics, FRC Team 3061's, starter project and library focused on a swerve-based drivetrain. Supports SDS MK4/MK4i swerve modules using 2 Falcon 500 motors and a CTRE CANCoder, a CTRE Pigeon Gyro, and REV Robotics power distribution hub and pneumatics hub. However, due to the hardware abstraction layer, this code can be adapted to other motor controllers, encoders, and gyros as well as different swerve module designs.

## Features 
* multiple robots, including a simulated robot with basic simulation of swerve modules
* logging and replay via [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/blob/main/README.md)
* CAN FD (CANivore) to reduce CAN bus utilization
* reports devices missing from the CAN bus
* swerve-specific features
  * robot-relative and field-relative driving modes
  * current limiting configuration for motors
  * x-stance
  * leave wheels rotated in last direction when not driving to enable smooth continuation of motion
  * switch drive motors to coast mode when robot is disabled and has stopped moving to facilitate manual pushing


## Team 2930 changes

This fork of the 3061 code is specific to Team 2930 the Sonic Squirrels. A big thank you to team 3061 for developing this library.

Major differences:

* Allow separate CAN bus name for motors and Pigeon (for compatibility with our 2022 robot)
* Use XboxController class for driver input
* automatically run spotlessApply on build to enforce code style, instead of just blocking on deploy
* support for not using Analog pressure sensor (for backwards compatibility with 2022 robot)
* use cSpell VS Code plugin and a lot of spelling corrections
* Use SDS Mk4i by default (original defaulted to Mk4)

**Configuration**
----
The following constants must be adjusted in the Constants.java, DrivetrainConstants.java, and SwerveModuleConstants.java files (all distance units must be in meters, and rotation units in degrees):</br>

* Constants.java
    * ```CAN_BUS_NAME``` constant: set to the name of the CANivore CAN FD bus or leave as an empty string if not using CANivore
    * ```RobotType``` enumeration: update to reflect your robots; leave ```ROBOT_SIMBOT``` if using simulation; update the ```getRobot``` and ```getMode``` methods to reflect new robots
* DrivetrainConstants.java
    * swerve module motor controllers and encoders CAN ID constants (e.g., ```FRONT_LEFT_MODULE_DRIVE_MOTOR```, ```FRONT_LEFT_MODULE_STEER_MOTOR```, ```FRONT_LEFT_MODULE_STEER_ENCODER```): set to the assigned CAN IDs
    * steer offset constants (e.g., ```FRONT_LEFT_MODULE_STEER_OFFSET```): refer to the Tuning section
    * ```TRACKWIDTH_METERS``` constant: set to the center-to-center distance of left and right modules
    * ```WHEELBASE_METERS``` constant: set to the center-to-center distance of front and rear module wheels
    * ```ROBOT_WIDTH_WITH_BUMPERS``` constant: set to the width of the robot including its bumpers
    * ```ROBOT_LENGTH_WITH_BUMPERS``` constant: set to the length of the robot including its bumpers
    * ```MAX_VELOCITY_METERS_PER_SECOND``` and ```MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_RADIANS_PER_SECOND``` constants: you can use the theoretical values, but it is better to physically drive the robot and find the actual max values.
    * ```PIGEON_ID``` constant: set to the CAN ID of the Pigeon; ensure that the gyro rotation is CCW+
* SwerveModuleConstants.java
    * ```WHEEL_DIAMETER_METERS``` constant: set to the diameter of the wheel in the swerve module
    * ```DRIVE_GEAR_RATIO``` and ```ANGLE_GEAR_RATIO``` constants: set to the gear ration of the swerve module's drive and turn mechanisms; the gear ratios must be defined such that they are greater than 1
    * ```DRIVE_MOTOR_INVERTED``` constant: when the drive motor is supplied a positive input, it turns the swerve module wheel such that the robot moves forward; if not, set to true
    * ```ANGLE_MOTOR_INVERTED``` constant: when the angle motor is supplied a positive input, it rotates the swerve module wheel such that the wheel rotates in the CCW direction; if not, set to true
    * ```CAN_CODER_INVERTED``` constant: when the angle motor rotates the swerve module wheel in a CCW direction, the CANcoder should increase its reading; if not, set to true
* PneumaticConstants.java
    * ```PNEUMATICS_HUB_ID``` constant: set the CAN ID of your REV Pneumatic hub
    * configure the channels for your flow sensor (if applicable) and high/low pressure sensor channels

**Tuning**
----

* Setting Steer Offsets (e.g., ```FRONT_LEFT_MODULE_STEER_OFFSET```) in DrivetrainConstants.java
    * set ```DEBUGGING``` in SwerveModule.java to true
    * for finding the offsets, use a piece of 1x1 metal that is straight against the forks of the front and back modules (on the left and right side) to ensure that the modules are straight
    * point the bevel gears of all the wheels in the same direction (either facing left or right), and preferably you should have the wheels facing in the direction where a positive input to the drive motor drives forward; if for some reason you set the offsets with the wheels backwards, you can change the ```DRIVE_MOTOR_INVERTED``` to fix
    * open Shuffleboard, go to the SwerveModule tab, and see 4 indicators called "Mod 0 Cancoder", "Mod 1 Cancoder", etc. If you have already straightened the modules, copy those 4 numbers exactly (to 2 decimal places) to their respective ```STEER_OFFSET``` constants
    * set ```DEBUGGING``` in SwerveModule.java back to false
* Angle Motor PID Values (```ANGLE_KP```, ```ANGLE_KI```, ```ANGLE_KD```) in SwerveModuleConstants.java:
    * set ```TUNING_MODE``` in Constants.java to true
    * open Shuffleboard, go to the SmartDashboard tab, and see controls for each of the PID values; values can be changed via these controls as you interactively tune the controller
    * start with a low P value (0.01)
    * multiply by 10 until the module starts oscillating around the set point
    * scale back by searching for the value (for example, if it starts oscillating at a P of 10, then try (10 -> 5 -> 7.5 -> etc.)) until the module overshoots the setpoint but corrects with no oscillation
    * repeat the process for D; the D value will basically help prevent the overshoot
    * ignore I
    * copy the values from the Shuffleboard controls into SwerveModuleConstants.java
    * set ```TUNING_MODE``` in Constants.java to false
* Drive characterization values (```DRIVE_KS```, ```DRIVE_KV```, ```DRIVE_KA```) in SwerveModuleConstants.java:
    * in Shuffleboard, set the "Auto Routine" chooser to "Drive Characterization"
    * start the autonomous period
    * the ```FeedForwardCharacterization``` command will run and output the KS and KV values (you do not need to lock the modules straight forward as the code will keep them oriented in the forward direction)
    * copy the KS and KV values into SwerveModuleConstants.java
* Drive Motor PID Values (```DRIVE_KP```, ```DRIVE_KI```, ```DRIVE_KD```) in SwerveModuleConstants.java:
    * set ```TUNING_MODE``` in Constants.java to true
    * open Shuffleboard, go to the SmartDashboard tab, and see controls for each of the PID values; values can be changed via these controls as you interactively tune the controller
    * tune ```DRIVE_KP``` until it doesn't overshoot and doesn't oscillate around a target velocity
    * copy the values from the Shuffleboard controls into SwerveModuleConstants.java
    * set ```TUNING_MODE``` in Constants.java to false
* ```AUTO_DRIVE_P_CONTROLLER``` and ```AUTO_TURN_P_CONTROLLER``` constants in DrivetrainConstants.java:
    * set ```TUNING_MODE``` in Constants.java to true
    * open Shuffleboard, go to the SmartDashboard tab, and see controls for each of the PID values; values can be changed via these controls as you interactively tune the controller
    * tune until until auto paths are smoothly followed
    * copy the values from the Shuffleboard controls into DrivetrainConstants.java
    * set ```TUNING_MODE``` in Constants.java to false

**Joystick Mappings (original 3061-lib not 2930 fork)**
----
* This code is setup to use a single XBox controller to control the robot
* The left stick controls translation (forwards and sideways movement), and the right stick controls rotation.
* The B button toggles between field-relative and robot-centric driving.
* The back button zeroes the gyro, useful when testing teleop, just rotate the robot forwards, and press the button to rezero.
* The A button enables x-stance while pressed.

**Gradle Commands**

Gradle, the build system, has been configured to use `Spotless` a syntax linter, that will check and enforce the coding style. Whenever the project is built, the code will have any style issues corrected. These corrections will need to be checked before committing the code via git. Below are some useful gradle commands.

Some important gradle commands:

* `gradlew spotlessApply` to run code formatting
* `gradlew deploy` to both build and deploy code to the rio
* `gradlew build` to build robot code (but **does not deploy**)

Some other useful gradle commands:

* `gradlew tasks` to view all available tasks
* `gradlew clean` to remove build cache (can be used to troubleshoot odd build errors)
* `gradlew Glass` to run Glass (WPILib graphing tool)
* `gradlew PathWeaver` to run PathWeaver (WPILib path gen tool)
* `gradlew ShuffleBoard` to run ShuffleBoard (WPILib Dashboard tool)
* `gradlew SysId` to run SysID (WPILib characterization tool)
